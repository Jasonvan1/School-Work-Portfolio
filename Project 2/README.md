Project Objective: Analyze user engagement and revenue strategies for Ziga, a social networking app for entrepreneurs, to identify challenges and recommend actionable solutions.

About Ziga:
Ziga connects entrepreneurs with like-minded individuals to foster collaboration and business growth. Despite leading in business-partner matchmaking technologies, the app struggles with low user downloads and limited subscription revenue.

Assessed how key events and app features, such as messaging, influence user engagement and retention.
Screen Popularity and Retention:
Evaluated screen-level popularity (views per user) and its correlation to retention rates, identifying high-impact areas for development.
User Behavior Patterns:
Investigated user behavior, particularly on high-view, low-engagement screens, to align the app's design with user preferences.
Key Insights and Recommendations:

Enhanced understanding of user engagement's role in revenue generation.
Prioritized feature development based on impact analysis of app functionalities.
Focused on optimizing popular screens to boost retention.

Visualization software to identify key patterns and correlations.
Outcome:
This project delivered actionable strategies to improve Ziga's user engagement and subscription revenue, positioning the app for future growth in its target market.
