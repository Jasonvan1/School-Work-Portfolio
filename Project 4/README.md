Objective:
To enhance anti-money laundering (AML) efforts by analyzing suspicious transaction data, creating predictive models, and identifying trends to assist Compliance Analytics LLC and financial institutions in preventing money laundering.

Key Deliverables:
Statistical Analysis:
Analyzed transaction dataset for key metrics such as mean, max, min, standard deviation, and percentiles.
Verified and adjusted data completeness for accurate analysis.
Predictive Modeling:
Built and evaluated models using Google Colab to predict suspicious activities and achieve the highest accuracy scores.
Modified dataset columns to improve model performance.
Data Visualization:
Used Tableau to identify trends in regulatory findings and highlight countries with the most penalties.
Visualized suspicious activities to provide actionable insights.
SQL Scenario Logic:
Developed SQL queries to identify Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and transactions linked to high-risk countries.
Hypothesis and Business Case:
Hypothesis: Money laundering can be tracked and mitigated by inspecting suspicious transactions involving individuals, banks, and corporations.

Business Case:

Financial institutions face severe penalties for AML non-compliance (e.g., Capital One fined $400M; Standard Chartered fined $650B).
Effective AML programs prevent fraud, improve transparency, and strengthen financial systems.
Insights from this project will aid Compliance Analytics LLC in future tracking and prevention projects.
Tools and Techniques Used:
Data Models: Python, SQL, Tableau, Google Colab, Oracle.
Statistical Analysis: Conducted on transactional data to identify patterns and high-risk behaviors.
Predictive Analytics: Developed models to flag suspicious activities with a focus on multifactor alerts.
Visualization: Tableau dashboards for trend analysis in regulatory compliance and high-risk countries.
Data Sourcing and Quality:
Sample datasets with verified transactional and customer data.
Key customer metrics: name, status, account number, country, and risk ratings.
Transactional metrics: customer type, transaction date, transaction number, and associated information.
Data quality was validated with project sponsor guidance, ensuring completeness and utility.
Challenges and Solutions:
Data Cleaning Issues:
Resolved spacing errors (e.g., /n) and standardized datasets for model inputs.
Technical Limitations:
Addressed challenges in combining datasets and coding errors by collaborating and documenting steps thoroughly.
Computing Constraints:
Optimized workflows using Google Drive for accessible and organized data management.
Key Takeaways and Business Benefits:
Strengthened AML compliance efforts to reduce fraud and prevent costly government settlements.
Reinforced transparency and trust between financial institutions, regulators, and customers.
Demonstrated the potential of data analytics in identifying and mitigating money laundering risks effectively.
Conclusion:
Through robust data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization, this project highlights how data analytics can play a pivotal role in safeguarding financial institutions from risks associated with money laundering.
