Project Objective: Analyze the impact of artificial intelligence on job automation, focusing on how the risk varies across different professions and income levels, and propose strategies to prepare the workforce for AI-driven changes.

Key Issues Addressed:

Impact on the Workforce:
Explored the phases of AI-driven automation:
Algorithmic Phase: Clerical and administrative roles, predominantly held by women, face the highest risk.
Augmentation Phase: Amplified risks from advanced technology.
Autonomy Phase: Up to 30% of jobs face automation, affecting men disproportionately in manual labor roles.
Income and Automation Risk:
High-paying jobs (e.g., Occupational Therapists and Physicians) show near-zero risk of automation.
Low-paying jobs (e.g., cashiers, inspectors, and waiters) face 90%-100% automation risk within 10–25 years.
Counterintuitive Findings:
Middle-income trade jobs (electricians, plumbers) and healthcare roles face lower automation risks due to the need for skilled, hands-on labor.
Some high-income white-collar jobs (lawyers, accountants) face greater risk due to AI’s capacity for accurate, repetitive data-driven tasks.
Proposed Workforce Strategies:

Educational Investments:
Train employees in data science, programming, and AI-related technologies.
Develop soft skills like leadership, creative thinking, and conflict resolution, which are challenging for AI to replicate.
Practical Training:
Hands-on training for managing AI systems and datasets.
Offer continuous learning opportunities through conferences and seminars.
Adaptation of Employers:
Encourage organizations to evolve alongside AI by fostering a culture of upskilling and innovation.
Outcome:
This project underscores the need for proactive measures in workforce development to mitigate the risks posed by AI-driven job automation and highlights the importance of bridging the gap between evolving technology and human adaptability.
