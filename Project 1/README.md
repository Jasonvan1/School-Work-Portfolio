Course: INFO 581 â€“ Process Mining
Tools Used: Celonis EMS

Description:
This project utilized Celonis EMS to analyze business process data and uncover inefficiencies in task execution, focusing on the prepaid travel cost activities. The analysis identified a significant throughput time issue, with tasks exceeding the optimal average by 13 days and a hit rate of only 52%.

Key Contributions:

Process Analysis: Explored individual steps and their relationships, highlighting activities negatively impacting throughput time.
Actionable Insights: Pinpointed activities (e.g., 10305, 10392, 1053, 10847, 11058) as major contributors to delays and proposed targeted improvements.
Optimization Recommendations: Suggested changes to reduce throughput time from 37 to under 24 days and improve the hit rate from 52% to 95%.
Improved Workflow: Highlighted additional high-impact activities (e.g., 505, 427) for further optimization and emphasized adherence to the optimal process route.
Outcome:
The project provided data-driven recommendations to enhance organizational performance by reducing costs and improving efficiency in prepaid travel cost activities.
